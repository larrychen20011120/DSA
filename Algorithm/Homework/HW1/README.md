# HW1 Problems
There are three problems in this homework with different difficulties.
## Arashi's Craft
### Description
Arashi87 is addicted to a game called "arashi's craft" recently. All the items in this game are made of blocks. The first thing to do while being a newbie in the game is definitely building a beautiful house, but arashi87 doesn't have too much blocks to use. To cost down, arashi87 hopes that you can write a program to help him see the result of the house after several operations.

We made the problem simple. Now we have number  to  blocks put on  slots in order, with the following operations:

* `move a onto b`: put the blocks stacked on **No. a** block and **No. b** block back to the top of their original slots, then put **No. a** block onto **No. b**block.
* `move a over b`: put the blocks stacked on **No. a** block back to the top of their original slots, then put **No. a** block on top of the pile that contains **No. b** block.
* `pile a onto b`: put the blocks stacked on **No. b** block back to the top of their original slots, then put the whole pile of blocks above **No. a** block (including a) onto **No. b** block.
* `pile a over b`: put the whole pile of blocks above **No. a** block (including a) on top of the pile that contains **No. b** block.

Please note that when the block  and the block  are in the same pile, the operation get skipped. The final result should be printed after all the operations are done.
